# Machine Learning and Computer Vision Projects

## 1. Wine Customer Segmentation
### Objective
Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Logistic Regression** to segment customers based on their wine preferences.

### Work Done
- Preprocessed the dataset to remove noise and ensure data quality.
- Applied **PCA** to reduce dimensionality and identify key factors for customer segmentation.
- Used **Logistic Regression** to classify customers into distinct segments for targeted marketing.

### Key Technologies
- PCA for feature reduction.
- Logistic Regression for classification.

## 2. Review Sentiment Analysis (NLP System)
### Objective
Developed an **NLP-based sentiment analysis** system for customer reviews using **Naive Bayes** and the **Porter Stemmer** algorithm.

### Work Done
- Preprocessed customer reviews by removing stop words and applying stemming using the **Porter Stemmer**.
- Used **Naive Bayes** classifier for sentiment classification into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

### Key Technologies
- **Naive Bayes** for sentiment classification.
- **Porter Stemmer** for text preprocessing.

## 3. Gesture-Controlled Sound System
### Objective
Built a **gesture-controlled sound system** using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to enable hands-free control of audio.

### Work Done
- Developed a system that detects hand gestures using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**.
- Configured hand gestures to control sound system operations like play, pause, volume control, and track navigation.

### Key Technologies
- **OpenCV** for video processing.
- **MediaPipe** for hand gesture recognition.
